    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Needed more reasons to guzzl-I mean cook with white wine. Seriously though, once you make this, it'll never leave your cookbook.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Prep: 15 minutes</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Cook: 30 minutes</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Total: 45 minutes</strong></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-1 1/2lbs boneless chicken breasts, pounded 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter, divided</li>
        <li>1(8oz)package pre-sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tbsp shallots</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2/3 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tsp thyme</li>
        <li>2 tbsp parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, salt and pepper in ziplock bag. Add chicken to bag; seal tightly and shake to coat chicken evenly. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flour-dusted chicken in pan, first shaking off any excess, cook, turning once, until chicken is golden and just barely cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining butter in pan. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add shallots, garlic, and salt; cook for 2 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add broth, wine, heavy cream, thyme, salt and pepper; use wooden spoon to scrape brown bits from pan to liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and gently boil, uncovered, until the sauce is reduced by half, slightly thickened, and darkened in color, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken back to pan, and baste with excess juices. Reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken is warmed through and sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
